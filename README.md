# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

We used inheritance and we started with the league file and from that the season file draws from the league. The game_stats file inherited from season and then the team_stats file inherited from game_stats.

We created modules to collect data from the CSV's.
